epoch, 1970-01-01": no annotation was generated then. It is what a writer
stamps when it has nothing better (the REST path did so until lacing#35),

backfill (lacing#44). ``RationalTime(0, r) == RationalTime(0, s)`` for any
rates, so comparing against this constant is rate-independent.

Consumers must read it as *unknown*, and unknown resolves the safe way:
an annotation whose own generation time — or whose upstream parent's — is
unknown is **unverifiable**, hence stale, never "the oldest thing in the
