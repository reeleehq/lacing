"""Content-addressed artifact references.

An :class:`Artifact` is a generated file (or remote URL) with provenance.
Anything that *produces* media — a fal.ai call, a ``ffmpeg`` compose, a
storyboard PDF render, an audio synthesis — returns an ``Artifact``.
Anything that *references* an artifact temporally does so via
``MediaRef(asset_id=artifact.asset_id, interval=…)``.

This type lives in lacing (not in falaw or any single producer) because:

- It reuses :class:`lacing.Provenance` and :class:`lacing.MediaRef`. The
  ``asset_id`` *is* the content hash that ``MediaRef`` already documents.
- Multiple producers (falaw, an, nw, artful, mixing) need to express
  "I produced a file." Putting ``Artifact`` in any one of them forces a
  wrong-direction dependency from the others.
- The provenance chain (``was_derived_from``, ``was_generated_by``) is the
  same shape for an annotation and an artifact. Reusing it unifies lineage.

Hashing
-------

``asset_id`` is the SHA-256 hex digest of the artifact's bytes. SHA-256 is
in the stdlib, deterministic, and compatible with the
``MediaRef.asset_id`` documentation ("BLAKE3 / SHA-256"). Producers may use
BLAKE3 if they prefer; the consumer treats ``asset_id`` opaquely.

Examples
--------

>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> from lacing.artifact import Artifact, hash_file
>>> # Create one from a path:
>>> import tempfile
>>> with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile("wb", suffix=".bin", delete=False) as f:
...     _ = f.write(b"hello world")
...     p = Path(f.name)
>>> a = Artifact.from_path(p, kind="text", was_generated_by="test:doctest",
...                        was_attributed_to="user:thor")
>>> a.kind
'text'
>>> a.bytes_size
11
>>> len(a.asset_id) == 64  # SHA-256 hex
True
>>> a.path == p
True

An artifact that was *acquired* rather than made carries a :class:`Rights`
record (``None`` means "we made this", not "unknown"):

>>> from lacing.artifact import Rights
>>> a = Artifact.from_bytes(b"png", kind="image", was_generated_by="fetch:openverse",
...     was_attributed_to="user:thor",
...     rights=Rights(provider="openverse", license="by-sa", author="Ada"))
>>> a.rights.license
'by-sa'
>>> Artifact.from_bytes(b"x", kind="text", was_generated_by="t",
...     was_attributed_to="u").rights is None
True

Round-trip through JSON:

>>> import json
>>> data = a.model_dump_json()
>>> b = Artifact.model_validate_json(data)
>>> b.asset_id == a.asset_id
True

    """Who owns the bytes of an *acquired* artifact, and on what terms.

    The fields a Creative-Commons-family licence needs to discharge its
    attribution duty (title, author, source, licence: "TASL"), named
    literal-for-literal after the two records the federation already keeps —
    ``illustration.ImageResult`` and ``an.ir.assets.AssetSource`` — so both map
    onto this one without a rename table (``provider``, ``id``, ``license``,
    ``license_url``, ``attribution``, ``source_page_url``, ``author``,
    ``author_url``, ``cacheable``).

    Semantics worth the trap they avoid:

    - **``Artifact.rights is None`` means "we made this"**, not "unknown". An
      acquired artifact whose terms nobody recorded is a ``Rights`` with only
      ``provider`` set.
    - **``license is None`` means UNKNOWN, never unencumbered.** Free of
      obligations is stated, e.g. ``license="cc0-1.0"``.
    - **``cacheable is None`` means not stated**; ``False`` forbids keeping the
      bytes, ``True`` permits it.
    - ``license`` is an SPDX id (``"CC-BY-4.0"``) or a provider's own code
      (``"by-sa"``); lacing records it verbatim and never classifies it
      (classification lives with the consumer, e.g. ``an``'s licence classes).
    - The record describes **this artifact's own bytes**. A render that embeds
      a third-party image carries no ``Rights`` of its own; its obligations
      travel through ``provenance.was_derived_from`` and are rolled up by the
      consumer. ``rights is None`` on a derivative is *not* a clearance.

    ``provider`` is required, so an empty ``Rights()`` cannot exist: an
    artifact either has no record (we made it) or says where it came from.
    Text fields are ``None`` or non-blank; a blank string is refused.

    An artifact catalog is often keyed by ``asset_id`` (the content hash), so
    two records for the *same bytes* are one row. By default
    :class:`lacing.ArtifactStore` keeps the existing ``rights`` when a record
    with ``rights=None`` replaces one for the same bytes (its default
    ``on_write`` policy, :func:`lacing.keep_rights`; lacing#60): the bytes'
    obligations do not lapse because someone recorded them again. An explicit
    ``rights`` replaces the old one; to clear rights, delete the record first.
    ``on_write=None`` restores last-write-wins, and a policy that refuses such
    a write instead is a small function passed as ``on_write``.
