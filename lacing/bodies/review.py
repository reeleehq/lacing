"""Body schema for review notes — the edit-loop's communication channel.

URI: ``annot://schema/review/v1``

A *review* annotation is a structured note attached to one or more
artifacts (a panel, a beat, a segmentation alternate, a render result),
optionally pointing at a typed payload like a
:class:`ContinuityViolationBodyV1`. Reviews are produced by:

- automated checkers (continuity, grammar, timing, segmentation rules)
- the edit-loop ("this caption needs a revision")
- the orchestrator ("the user declined the cost gate at panel 12")
- the user ("approve" / "needs revision" notes)

The body is intentionally minimal. The kind (``review_kind``) routes
the FE renderer; the payload is opaque to lacing.

An ``approval`` review carries a ``decision`` — this is the record
:func:`lacing.server.operations.accept_ai_suggestion` writes when a human
accepts or rejects an AI suggestion, so that the human's edit is
attributed to the human without overwriting the agent's provenance on the
annotation being judged (lacing#18).

.. note::

   ``decision`` is **additive and optional**, so stored bodies validate
   unchanged and lacing owes no migration. Downstream mirrors of this
   schema are a different matter: reelee-web's generated Zod type is
   ``.strict()`` and its JSON Schema is ``additionalProperties: false``,
   so an additive field here is a *breaking* change there until the
   mirror is regenerated — tracked as thorwhalen/reelee-web#234.

Why this is a field rather than something to read off the reviewed
annotation's ``confidence``: the verdict is a fact about *the review
event*, and ``confidence`` is a mutable field on a different record that
the next write can move. Recovering "was this accepted?" by dereferencing
a live value is exactly the coupling that made lacing#18 possible."""
