"""Artifact store — a metadata catalog and a blob store behind one facade.

An :class:`~lacing.artifact.Artifact` describes a generated file; this module
*persists* artifacts. It is the storage layer that ``reelee`` (and any other
producer) builds on so artifacts survive a process restart and are reachable
from another machine — not just from the browser tab that generated them.

Design
------

The store keeps **three concerns separate** (see
``misc/docs/Artifact Store Architecture — design notes.md``):

- **Data organization** — artifacts are *physically flat*: a **catalog**
  (``id -> record``) holds metadata, a **blob store** (``content_hash ->
  bytes``) holds the heavy bytes. Neither key encodes ownership or grouping.
- **Infrastructure mapping** — :class:`ArtifactStore` is a thin *facade* that
  composes two **injected** key-value stores. The backing stores are ordinary
  ``MutableMapping`` objects, so the backend swaps (in-memory -> filesystem ->
  object store) by dependency injection, with no change to callers.
- **Access calculus** — deliberately *absent here*. :class:`ArtifactStore` is
  an unprivileged primitive that checks nothing; a caller that needs access
  control wraps it in a permission-enforcing facade of its own.

Identity is an **explicit string key**, not assumed to be the content hash:
artifacts often get a stable id *before* their bytes exist (and hence before
they can be hashed). The catalog is therefore generic over the record type and
keyed by whatever id the caller chooses; the content hash, when known, is just
a field on the record and the key of the blob store.

Consistency: there is no transaction spanning the two stores, so :meth:`save`
writes the **blob first, then the catalog row**. Because blobs are
content-addressed the blob write is idempotent; a crash in between leaves at
worst an unreferenced (orphan) blob — never a catalog row pointing at missing
bytes.

Examples
--------

>>> from lacing import Artifact
>>> store = ArtifactStore.in_memory()
>>> art = Artifact.from_bytes(
...     b"fake-png-bytes", kind="image",
...     was_generated_by="agent:flux", was_attributed_to="user:thor",
... )
>>> _ = store.save(art.asset_id, art)
>>> store[art.asset_id].kind
'image'
>>> art.asset_id in store
True
>>> len(store)

class _ContainedDirStore(MutableMapping):
    """A ``dol.Files``-like store whose keys cannot leave its ``rootdir``.

    ``dol.Files`` joins keys onto its root by string and follows ``..`` and
    symlinks, so a key is a path anywhere on disk. This wrapper routes every
    key through the containment seam of the blob reads (lacing#50/#55).
    A key is accepted only if (see :meth:`_contained_key`):

    - it has no ``..`` segment — refused outright rather than normalised, so
      ``"x/../b"`` can never alias record ``b``;
    - it is relative (no absolute path, no drive) and :func:`_resolve_within`
      keeps it inside ``rootdir`` — which refuses NUL bytes and symlinks
      pointing out; and
    - its parent directory resolves inside ``rootdir`` too, so acting on the
      final *name* (a delete never follows it) cannot land outside.

    Reads go through :func:`_open_within`, the same descriptor-based,
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` read as :meth:`ArtifactStore.get_blob`. Writes and
    deletes are delegated to the wrapped store on the (normalised) key the
    caller gave, so its write and delete policy (e.g. trash on delete) is
    unchanged, and deleting an in-root symlink removes the link, not its
    target. Writing over something that is not a regular file (a FIFO would
    hang the writer) is refused. Listing is :func:`_iter_within`: no
    symlinked directories followed.

    A refused key raises ``KeyError`` on get/set/del and is not ``in`` the
    store. Writes are checked by name, then opened by name by the wrapped
    store: a party that can already write inside ``rootdir`` could race a
    symlink in between. That is the same point-in-time caveat as
    :meth:`ArtifactStore.blob_path`; keys from outside the store cannot open
    it.
