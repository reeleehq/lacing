"""Body schema for continuity violations — generic, cross-media.

URI: ``annot://schema/continuity-violation/v1``

A *continuity violation* is a typed claim about a relationship between
two or more annotations: "panels 5 and 6 cross the 180° axis", "the
character drift between panel 3 and panel 4 exceeds the embed-distance
threshold", "object detection finds a prop in panel 7 absent from
panel 8."

The schema is intentionally generic. Specific rule families live in
their producing packages — reelee defines axis_180, character_drift,
prop_hallucination, etc. via dedicated Transforms — but the *envelope*
that carries the result is generic enough to live in lacing.

Violations attach as ``review/v1`` annotations whose ``review_kind ==
"continuity"`` (see :mod:`lacing.bodies.review`).

Reference: ``reelee/docs/Narrative to Storyboard.md`` §6.5, §8.1.
