"""Body schema for review *candidates* — "this needs a human's eyes".

URI: ``annot://schema/review-candidate/v1``

A review-candidate is what an automated processor emits when it flags an
annotation as worth a human look — today,
:func:`lacing.processors.low_confidence_review` flagging low-confidence
rows. It is deliberately NOT a :class:`~lacing.bodies.review.ReviewBodyV1`:

- a review is a structured **note or verdict** (a continuity observation,
  an approval carrying a ``decision``) written *about* work;
- a candidate is a **pointer into a queue** — "look at this one, and here
  is why it was flagged" — with no message, no status lifecycle, and no
  verdict. Reviewing a candidate *produces* a review; the candidate is the
  input, not an early draft of the output.

The two lived under one URI for a while, and the processor's rows failed
validation against the model registered for that URI in five ways at once
(lacing#37). One URI per body shape is the contract ``body_schema_uri``
exists to keep; giving the candidate its own name is the whole fix — no
stored ``review/v1`` body changes shape, so no migration.

The tier split mirrors the body split, stated here because it is easy to
read as an accident: candidates land on ``"for-review"`` (the processor's
default) while human/agent reviews land on ``"review"``
(``operations.DFLT_REVIEW_TIER``). Candidates queue; reviews record.
