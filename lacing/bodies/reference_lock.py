"""Body schema for a *locked reference* — a first-class “this is canonical”.

URI: ``annot://schema/reference-lock/v1``

A **reference lock** records the decision that one or more reference
artifacts *are* the canonical anchor for some subject — a character's
face, a location's architecture, a style, a prop. Once a subject is
locked, a *supervisor* can check every later generation against the
locked anchor and flag drift (the consumer in reelee runs the
identity/likeness comparison and emits ``continuity-violation/v1``
annotations; this schema only carries the *decision*, not the result).

The shape is deliberately general so it fits several real workflows
without a schema bump:

- **One image or a set.** ``locked_artifact_ids`` holds 1..N artifacts.
  Lock a single canonical headshot, or a set (front / three-quarter /
  full-body / expression sheet). ``primary_artifact_id`` names the one
  to show by default.
- **Project- or scene-scoped.** ``scope`` is ``"project"`` by default
  (the character is locked for the whole piece) or ``"scene"`` (a
  re-lock for a flashback / costume change), in which case
  ``scope_ref`` names the scene/segment it applies to. Re-locks chain
  via ``supersedes`` (the prior lock's annotation id).
- **Per-aspect checklist with advisory-by-default gating.**
  ``checklist`` is the set of aspects the supervisor compares
  (``"face"``, ``"architecture"``, ``"props"``, ``"lighting"``,
  ``"costume"``, ``"palette"``, …). ``hard_gates`` is the subset that
  *blocks* on mismatch; it defaults to empty, so every aspect is
  **advisory** (flag, never auto-reject) — honouring the field
  observation that over-strict likeness filters waste the user's time
  rejecting perfectly good images.

The lock is itself an annotation; *who* locked it and *when* live in
the annotation's PROV-O provenance, not in this body.
