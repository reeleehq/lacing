"""Built-in body schemas.

Each module in this package defines one body schema (Pydantic v2 model)
and registers it under an ``annot://schema/<name>/v<major>`` URI.

These are the seed schemas users can reach for; they're not authoritative
beyond demonstrating the pattern. Custom packages should register their
own under their own names.

Importing this package registers every built-in body schema.
