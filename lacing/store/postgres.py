"""PostgreSQL-backed annotation store using ``int8range`` + GiST.

Maps lacing's interval model to Postgres native range types (BACK-DOC §4.2):

============== =====================================================
Allen relation Postgres operator (int8range / tstzrange)
============== =====================================================
overlaps (any) ``a && b``      — any kind of intersection
during         ``a <@ b``      — a contained in b (strict variant: see code)
contains       ``a @> b``      — a contains b (strict variant: see code)
meets / met_by ``a -|- b``     — adjacent (touching but not overlapping)
equals         ``a = b``
before         ``a << b``
after          ``a >> b``
strict overlap ``a && b AND lower(a) < lower(b) AND upper(a) < upper(b)``
============== =====================================================

We store intervals as ``int8range(start_value, end_value, '[)')`` — half-open,
matching lacing's ``TimeInterval`` semantics — at a **per-(owner, project)
rate** recorded in the ``projects`` table. All inserts must be at that rate;
re-quantizing happens on insert if necessary.

GiST index on the range column gives sub-millisecond overlap queries at
million-row scale. Optional ``EXCLUDE USING GIST`` constraints are added
**per tier** for stereotypes like ``TIME_SUBDIVISION`` that forbid overlap.

Multi-tenancy (Phase 4, reelee#177)
-----------------------------------

Multiple logical stores (one per nw/reelee project) coexist in a single
Postgres database via **tenant columns on shared tables** (the decision in
``reelee/docs/storage_migration_plan.md`` §"Postgres tenancy"): every
``annotations`` and ``tiers`` row carries an ``owner_id`` and a ``project_id``,
and every query is scoped by ``(owner_id, project_id)``. A ``PostgresStore``
instance is bound to one ``(owner_id, project_id)`` at construction and behaves
exactly like a single-tenant store; two stores with different project ids over
the same database never see each other's rows.

``owner_id`` is a forward seam for the multi-tenant access layer (reelee#174):
the column is carried and scoped now, but its *enforcement* (the policy
decision point) is deferred — today every store defaults ``owner_id="default"``.

The per-tier ``EXCLUDE USING GIST`` no-overlap constraint is likewise scoped by
``(owner_id, project_id, tier)`` so one project's non-overlap rule cannot block
another project's annotations.

Connection pooling (Phase 4)
----------------------------

``nw``'s :class:`~nw.graph.ProjectGraph` opens and closes the store per
operation. That is fine for a SQLite file but pathological for a network DB, so
this module keeps a process-wide :class:`psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool` per
connection string (see :func:`get_pool`); a ``PostgresStore`` borrows a
connection from the pool for its lifetime and returns it on ``close()`` instead
of opening a fresh TCP/auth round-trip each time. When ``psycopg_pool`` is not
installed (or a caller passes ``use_pool=False``) we fall back to a dedicated
long-lived connection.

Schema versioning lives in ``meta``; mismatched versions raise on open.

Status: Phase 4. Tested via ``pytest-postgresql`` sandbox (no live server
needed for development).

v2 (Phase 4, reelee#177) added tenant columns (``owner_id`` / ``project_id``)

table holding the rate (was a single ``meta`` row in v1).

v3 (lacing#14, defect D5): ``prov_was_derived_from`` may contain 64-hex
artifact ``asset_id`` strings alongside annotation UUIDs. Layout and rows
unchanged — the bump makes pre-v3 builds (whose read path eagerly
``UUID()``-parses the column) refuse rather than crash mid-read.

The migration ladder (:mod:`lacing.store.migrations`,
``store_kind="postgres"``) is deliberately **empty**: no Postgres database
at any version ever held real data — the backend is config-selectable and
was never enabled in any environment; production has always been the
per-caller sqlite ``.annot`` layout (verified 2026-08-15, lacing#15).

v3 forward once a deployed Postgres exists."""
