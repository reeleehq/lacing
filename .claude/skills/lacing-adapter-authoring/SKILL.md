# Lacing — Adapter Authoring

Format support in lacing is **plugin-only**. The core never imports a format
module. Each adapter is a small, independent file in `lacing/adapters/` that
registers itself.

## The plugin contract

Every adapter exposes two functions and one registration call. The exact
signature is fixed by [lacing/adapters/__init__.py](../../../lacing/adapters/__init__.py):

```python
# lacing/adapters/<format>.py
import os
from lacing.adapters import adapter_generator_id, register_adapter
from lacing.store import IntervalAnnotationStore, MemoryStore

ADAPTER_NAME = "textgrid"
ADAPTER_VERSION = "1.0.0"  # semver; bump when the output shape changes
GENERATED_BY = str(adapter_generator_id(ADAPTER_NAME, ADAPTER_VERSION))
BODY_SCHEMA_URI = "annot://schema/textgrid-label/v1"


def load(
    source: str | bytes | os.PathLike,
    *,
    rate: int = DEFAULT_RATE,
    asset_id: str = "...",
    attribution: str = "anonymous",
    **kwargs,
) -> IntervalAnnotationStore:
    """Parse `source` into an in-memory store."""
    ...


def dump(
    store: IntervalAnnotationStore,
    target: str | os.PathLike | None = None,
    **kwargs,
) -> bytes | None:
    """Serialize `store`. If `target` is None, return bytes; else write to target."""
    ...


register_adapter(
    name=ADAPTER_NAME,
    version=ADAPTER_VERSION,
    load=load,
    dump=dump,
    extensions=(".TextGrid",),  # tuple, lowercased on register
    media_types=("text/x-praat-textgrid",),  # tuple
    body_schema_uris=(BODY_SCHEMA_URI,),  # tuple — adapters may emit multiple
    description="...",
)
```

Notes on the surface:
- `register_adapter` is keyword-only and returns the `AdapterSpec`.
- `version` (semver) is the vintage of what the adapter produces. Bump it when the output shape changes (a rounding rule, an extra body field), so provenance records which vintage produced an annotation (lacing#19).
- Registering a *different* spec under a taken name emits `RegistryConflictWarning` (it will become an error); pass `force=True` to replace on purpose. Re-registering an equal spec is a no-op.
- `body_schema_uris` is **plural / tuple** — adapters may produce multiple
  body shapes (e.g. cue + chapter schemas).
- `extensions` may be passed with or without leading dots; they're
  normalized to lowercase with leading dot in the registry.
- Use `register_adapter` (the registry, not direct imports) so users can
  swap or add formats without touching core.
- Reuse the shared helpers, never copy them: `lacing/adapters/_common.py` (annotations with an interval, media-only or any reference kind; reading bytes/path/inline text or JSON) and, for flat timed-cue formats, `lacing/adapters/_cues.py` (ms ⇄ `RationalTime`, clock formatting, payload rules).

## Round-trip is the acceptance test

Every adapter ships with a round-trip test:

```python
# tests/adapters/test_<format>.py
def test_roundtrip_<format>(sample_file):
    store1 = load(sample_file)
    blob = dump(store1)
    store2 = load(blob)
    assert_stores_equivalent(store1, store2)
```

`assert_stores_equivalent` compares **annotations modulo provenance
timestamps and IDs**, not byte-equality. Some formats are lossy by design
(WebVTT loses tier metadata). Document each lossy edge in the adapter
docstring with what gets dropped.

## Body schema URI

Every adapter declares one or more `body_schema_uri` values it produces.

- Format: `annot://schema/<name>/v<major>`.
- Bumps are **additive-only** by default. Breaking change → new major + a
  registered migration in `lacing/schema.py`.
- The URI travels with each annotation; the validator picks the right Zod /
  Pydantic schema by URI.

## License-check the parser before you depend on it

Before adding a parser library, check ANN-DOC §E or look up the package on
PyPI. **Never bring in:**

| Banned | Why | Use instead |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| `praat-parselmouth` | GPLv3+ | `praatio` (MIT) |
| `aeneas` | AGPL v3 | Montreal Forced Aligner (MIT) or write a thin parser |
| `portion` | LGPLv3 | `intervaltree` (Apache-2.0) |
| Peaks.js | LGPL-3.0 | wavesurfer.js v7 (BSD-3) |
| anything LGPL/GPL/AGPL/BSL | viral / commercial trap | find MIT/BSD/Apache equivalent or write a small parser |

If the only library is non-MIT/BSD/Apache, **write the parser** — most
annotation formats are XML/JSON/CSV with simple grammars (TextGrid is ~100
lines, EAF is XML).

## Time discipline at the parsing boundary

Parsers receive floats from external formats. Convert immediately:

```python
def _to_rational(seconds: float | str, rate: int = 24000) -> RationalTime:
    f = Fraction(seconds).limit_denominator(rate)
    val = int(f * rate)
    return RationalTime(value=val, rate=rate)
```

- Convert **once at the parse boundary**; everything internal is `RationalTime`.
- If the source format guarantees integer ticks (MIDI PPQN, ELAN ms), use them directly — don't go through float.
- Document the rate assumption in the adapter docstring.

## Tier mapping

Every format maps to lacing's ELAN tier stereotypes (Rule 6 in
`lacing-architecture`). When the source format has no equivalent
(WebVTT has flat tracks, no parent), pick `NONE` and document it.

| Format | Stereotype map |
|--------|----------------|
| Praat TextGrid IntervalTier | `NONE` |
| Praat TextGrid PointTier | `NONE` (point annotations) |
| ELAN EAF parent tier | `NONE` |
| ELAN EAF child with `Time_Subdivision` | `TIME_SUBDIVISION` |
| ELAN EAF `Symbolic_Subdivision` | `SYMBOLIC_SUBDIVISION` |
| ELAN EAF `Symbolic_Association` | `SYMBOLIC_ASSOCIATION` |
| ELAN EAF `Included_In` | `INCLUDED_IN` |
| WebVTT cues | `NONE` |
| W3C Web Annotation | `NONE` (use `motivation` for tier semantics) |

## Provenance on import

Every imported annotation gets:

```python
Provenance(
    was_generated_by=GENERATED_BY,  # adapter:<name>@<version>; never hand-format it
    was_attributed_to=kwargs.get("attribution", "anonymous"),
    was_derived_from=[source_asset_id],  # content hash of the source file
    generated_at_time=RationalTime.now(),
    activity="import",
)
```

If the source format encodes its own provenance (W3C Web Annotation has
`creator` + `created`), preserve it under `was_derived_from` chain — don't
overwrite.

## Common pitfalls (catch in review)

1. **Off-by-one on closed-vs-open intervals.** Praat is closed, lacing is half-open. Document the conversion.
2. **Encoding assumptions.** TextGrid can be Latin-1 or UTF-8 with BOM. Always sniff.
3. **Rate mismatch within a single file.** ELAN's `TIME_ORDER` defines named anchors with one rate; don't assume project rate.
4. **String labels with embedded delimiters.** WebVTT cues with `-->` in the body. Use the format's escape rules, not naive split.
5. **Empty intervals.** Some formats forbid `start == end`; lacing allows it. Document drop / convert.
6. **Lossy round-trip not flagged.** If the format can't represent confidence/provenance, the adapter must say so in its docstring **and** in the dump return metadata.

## Adapter checklist

- [ ] `load` and `dump` signatures match the contract.
- [ ] `register_adapter` called at module import.
- [ ] License of any underlying parser is MIT/BSD/Apache.
- [ ] All time conversions go through `_to_rational` at the boundary.
- [ ] Tier stereotype mapping documented.
- [ ] `ADAPTER_VERSION` set and passed to `register_adapter`; provenance set with `was_generated_by=GENERATED_BY` (`adapter:<name>@<version>`).
- [ ] Round-trip test on at least two real-world samples.
- [ ] Lossy fields documented in module docstring.
- [ ] `body_schema_uri` declared and registered.
- [ ] No core imports leaked into the adapter (it depends on `lacing.model`, not the other way).

## Adapter priority order (Phase 0 → Phase 1)

Phase 0: **TextGrid, WebVTT, W3C Web Annotation JSON-LD** — *all three
landed*. Three formats covering three audiences (linguistics, captions,
web/scholarly).

Phase 1: **ELAN EAF, JAMS, Label Studio JSON, OpenTimelineIO, CoNLL,
brat standoff, SubRip, TTML, CSV.**

Don't skip ahead — Phase 0 adapters validate the data model. If a Phase 0
adapter exposes a model gap, fix the model before adding more adapters.

## Examples to study

The Phase 0/1 adapters are deliberately diverse and demonstrate the pattern:

- [lacing/adapters/textgrid.py](../../../lacing/adapters/textgrid.py) — uses an external parser (`praatio`, MIT, optional install), maps both interval and point tiers, raises `ImportError` with the install hint when the extra is missing.
- [lacing/adapters/webvtt.py](../../../lacing/adapters/webvtt.py) — pure-Python parser, no dependency. Flat cues, no tier hierarchy. Demonstrates the `from_string-or-from-path` source heuristic.
- [lacing/adapters/web_annotation.py](../../../lacing/adapters/web_annotation.py) — JSON-LD, uses the standard `json` module. Demonstrates discriminated-union round-tripping and creator/provenance preservation.
- [lacing/adapters/annot.py](../../../lacing/adapters/annot.py) — *lossless* SQLite-based portable file format. Demonstrates the `persistent=True` mode (returns a live `SqliteStore` instead of a `MemoryStore`) and the fast-copy path when the source is already a `SqliteStore`.
- [lacing/adapters/eaf.py](../../../lacing/adapters/eaf.py) — ELAN EAF via `pympi-ling` (MIT, optional install). The first adapter that exercises the **tier hierarchy** end-to-end: maps EAF's `CONSTRAINTS` strings to lacing's four ELAN stereotypes verbatim, topo-sorts tiers on dump so parents are emitted before children, and pulls the first `MEDIA_DESCRIPTOR/MEDIA_URL` as the default `MediaRef.asset_id`.
- [lacing/adapters/jams.py](../../../lacing/adapters/jams.py) — JAMS (Music Information Retrieval) via `jams` (ISC, optional install). Maps each JAMS namespace to a lacing tier; observation values become `body['value']` preserving the namespace-typed value verbatim. Demonstrates handling of zero-duration point annotations (beats), `JObject`-vs-`dict` ambivalence in third-party libraries, and `Fraction(repr(float))` boundary conversion to recover exact rational time from float-seconds inputs.
