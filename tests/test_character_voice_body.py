"""``character-voice/v1`` — the shared per-character voice profile (lacing#10).

The promotion contract under test: the schema lives HERE (the issue's "no
reelee import required" acceptance criterion, previously false), it is a
strict SUPERSET of the shape reelee shipped under the same URI (every
stored body validates unchanged — no migration), and it carries the three
field groups the shipped subset dropped: the per-provider voice-id map,
the default emotional register, and the clone-sample artifact id that
lacing#14 made representable.
