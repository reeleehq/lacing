"""Tests for ``lacing.exhibit`` — the artifact-graph exhibit renderer.

The core is the pure ``annotations → HTML`` builder, exercised here with
lightweight stand-ins. The PDF / Markdown derivations are optional
converters; they are checked only for the "informative error when
absent" contract, not for output fidelity.
